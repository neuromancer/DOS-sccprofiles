# Steam controller profiles to play DOS games

A collection of [sc-controller](https://github.com/kozec/sc-controller) profiles to play old DOS games using the Steam Controller. All the profiles should work with the default configuration of the original games.

To use them, just import the individual profiles with sc-controller.

**Important**: As [stated by kozec](https://github.com/kozec/sc-controller/issues/202#issuecomment-303629722), you should always check that external profiles are not going to do something malicious.
